# rubygems-bundler && Noexec

Let's stop using `bundle exec`, kthx.

Introduction of the 1.0.0 release: http://niczsoft.com/2012/05/rubygems-bundler-integration-gem-1-0-0/

## Installation

    gem install rubygems-bundler

Next run (once):

    gem regenerate_binstubs

And you're done!

## Configuration

### ~/.gemrc

It's no more required to modify `~/.gemrc` anymore,
just remove the old entry to be sure it works as expected.
In case you need to use your own `custom_shebang`
you can define it in `~/.gemrc` to override the default:

    custom_shebang: $env <your_custom_shebang_program>

### ./.noexec.yaml

Though you can let noexec do it's own thing and rely on looking up your binary via your Gemfile,
you can also specify which binaries you want included or excluded.
Create a .noexec.yaml file along side any Gemfiles you want to use.
Then, to enable (or disable) the usage of your particular binary into your bundle,
add an include or exclude section. For example:

```yml
exclude: [rake]
```
Or,

```yml
include: [haml]
```

### Disabling

In case you need explicitly skip loading `Bundler.setup`, prefix your command with `NOEXEC_DISABLE=1`:

    NOEXEC_DISABLE=1

The old method is still available and might kick in if your tools use `NOEXEC` environment variable:

    NOEXEC=0 rails new app
    NOEXEC=skip gist

both `0` and `skip` will disable the gem, this method is deprecated and will be removed with 1.2.0.

## Problems?

Things not going the way you'd like? Try your command again with
`NOEXEC_DEBUG=1` set and create a ticket. I'll fix it right away!

### IRC support:

[#rubygems-bundler on irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#rubygems-bundler)

If you do not get relatively fast an answer make sure to leave an email to secure an later answer.

## How does this work (ruby_noexec_wrapper)

It modifies gem wrappers shebang to load `ruby_noexec_wrapper`.
Then, when you run gem binaries, it takes a look at your working directory,
and every directory above it until it can find a `Gemfile`.
If the executable you're running is present in your Gemfile,
it switches to using that `Gemfile` instead (via `Bundle.setup`).

Rubygems and Bundler integration, makes executable wrappers
generated by rubygems aware of bundler.

rubygems-bundler was merged with [noexec gem](https://github.com/joshbuddy/noexec) in version **0.9.0**.

## Uninstallation

    rubygems-bundler-uninstaller
    gem uninstall rubygems-bundler

this will set all gems to `/usr/bin/env ruby` which is one of the safest choices (especially when using rvm).

In case of rvm additional steps will ensure this gem is removed and not installed again:

    rvm get stable --without-gems=rubygems-bundler
    rvm all-gemsets do gem uninstall --all --executables rubygems-bundler
